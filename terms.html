            <h1>QuestPhone â€“ Terms and Conditions</h1>
<p><em>Effective Date: June 21, 2025</em></p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By accessing or using the QuestPhone application ("App", "Service", "we", or "our"), you agree to these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in your country) to use this App. By installing or using QuestPhone, you confirm that you meet this requirement and are legally able to enter into this agreement.</p>

<h2>3. Purpose of the App</h2>
<p>QuestPhone is a custom launcher that promotes reduced screen addiction by requiring users to complete real-world challenges before accessing selected apps. Tasks are verified using technologies such as Health Connect, AI-based photo recognition ("AI Snap"), app usage monitoring, and focus modes.</p>

<h2>4. Permissions and Data Usage</h2>
<p>QuestPhone requires certain permissions to provide its core functionality. By using the App, you acknowledge and consent to the following permissions and data usage:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Usage Stats Permission:</strong> Used to detect when selected apps are opened and to provide screen time insights. App usage data is processed locally and never shared with third parties.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Overlay Permissions:</strong> Required to block selected apps by overlaying QuestPhone when an addictive app is opened. This is done in real-time without collecting content from other apps.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Health Connect (Read Access Only):</strong> Used to verify completion of real-world health tasks such as steps taken, water intake, calories burned, or sleep duration. Data is accessed locally and only during task verification. We do not store or transmit any Health Connect data externally.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used for the AI Snap feature to verify completion of physical tasks through image recognition. Images are processed either locally or securely and are not retained unless required for verification or abuse prevention.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Notification Access:</strong> Required for sending reminders and alerts</li>
  
  <li><strong>Foreground Service:</strong> Required to actively monitor app launches and enforce distraction rules even while the app is running in the background.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Query All Packages:</strong> Needed to list all installed apps on your device so you can choose which ones to lock or monitor. This is required by Android for launcher functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> No data collected by QuestPhone is sold, rented, or shared with advertisers or third parties. All permissions are solely used to power in-app features that the user explicitly activates.</p>

<h2>5. Your Responsibilities</h2>
<p>By using QuestPhone, you agree:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To use the app for its intended purpose (screen-time control and self-improvement).</li>
  <li>Not to attempt to bypass or tamper with app restrictions or challenges.</li>
  <li>To comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your region.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Health and Safety Disclaimer</h2>
<p>QuestPhone may encourage you to perform physical or wellness tasks (e.g., walking, exercising, drinking water). These suggestions are for motivational purposes only and are not a substitute for medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional before engaging in any new fitness or health routine.</p>

<h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All content, code, images, branding, and trademarks in QuestPhone are the intellectual property of their respective owners. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or use any part of the App without prior written consent.</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>QuestPhone is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. We are not responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unintended app blocks or disruptions to your workflow.</li>
  <li>Failure to meet a specific health or productivity goal.</li>
  <li>Any physical or emotional outcome resulting from tasks or quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, QuestPhone and its developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via in-app notice or update logs. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>10. Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to QuestPhone without prior notice if you misuse the app, violate these Terms, or use it in any harmful or abusive manner.</p>

<h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your local jurisdiction. Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in your location.</p>

<h2>12. Contact</h2>
